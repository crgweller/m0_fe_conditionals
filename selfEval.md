1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

This was my first time forking and cloning down from github and I'm not super confident that I did everything right there.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I'm going to ask my small group about an error I was getting in terminal trying to use node to view my changes.
